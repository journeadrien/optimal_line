# optimal_line

Repo for Serge's operation line problem. The idea is to evaluate the risk of operation line failure due to sickness or accident with limited staff but more trained.

Stage 1:
Given an operation line with assign multiple-train operators, evalute the risk or probality of failure.

Stage 2:
Given an operation line, find the minimum operator to have the probality of failure under a percentage.

Stage 3:
Given an operation line with assign worker, find the best training program to reduce the failure at maximum.
