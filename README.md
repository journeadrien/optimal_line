# optimal_line

Repo for Serge's operation line problem. The idea is to evaluate the risk of operation line failure due to sickness or accident with limited staff but more trained.



Stage 1:
For the simulation model: see [chat](https://poe.com/s/S8Oc1si01knpwlOyjmJv)
For the config and demo: see [chat](https://poe.com/s/LvXLxCDHQhLU8moXt5pg)

Stage 2:
Given an operation line, find the minimum operator to have the probality of failure under a percentage.

Stage 3:
Given an operation line with assign worker, find the best training program to reduce the failure at maximum.
